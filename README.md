# All-Balanced-Parentheses-in-CodeWars
Hello! I'm a first year student of Computer Engineering.
This is my answer for All Balanced Parentheses in CodeWars (4 kyu).
Unfortunately, when I update this answer, the site tells me that this code is not efficiently enough.
I update it here because I consider it good (and because I work hard in this project hahaha).
I made it with my friend Ubiratan da Motta Filho, check out his profile!
If you have some tip for make this algorithm better, comment please (I'm a begginer =D).
